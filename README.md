# Minecraft Load Hammer

**Minecraft Load Hammer** is a network load testing tool designed to simulate multiple concurrent connections to a Minecraft server. It helps server administrators, developers, and network engineers assess the serverâ€™s performance by sending large data packets and simulating real-world traffic. This tool can uncover performance bottlenecks, network congestion, and assess the server's ability to handle heavy loads.

Whether you are testing your own server infrastructure or simulating various network conditions, Minecraft Load Hammer provides the insights you need to ensure stability and performance during peak traffic.

## Features:
- **Simulates Multiple Concurrent Connections**: The tool allows you to simulate any number of clients (threads) connecting to your Minecraft server concurrently. This is useful for stress testing to ensure the server can handle multiple users.
- **Sends Large Data Packets**: By sending large packets (ranging from 100MB to 1GB), the tool mimics the data load that users might generate during gameplay, particularly when interacting with complex systems like large worlds or active player interactions.
- **Calculates Packet Loss**: During the simulation, the tool tracks the number of failed connection attempts and computes packet loss as a percentage, offering a clear indicator of network issues.
- **Customizable Load Settings**: You can define the number of simulated connections, packet size, delay between connections, and other parameters, enabling flexible and controlled testing.
- **Simple Python Script**: Built using only standard Python libraries, the tool is easy to run and modify, making it accessible to both novice users and experienced developers.

## Requirements:
- **Python 3.x** (Ensure Python is installed on your system)
- **Libraries**: No additional libraries are required, as the tool relies on standard Python libraries:
  - `socket` (for establishing TCP connections)
  - `threading` (for simulating concurrent clients)
  - `time` (for controlling connection delays)
  - `os` (for generating random data payloads)

Disclaimer:
Minecraft Load Hammer is intended for educational purposes only. The author does not take responsibility for any damage or disruption caused by using this tool. The use of this tool without permission on servers you do not own or control may violate terms of service agreements and potentially local laws.

Server Downtime: Stress testing can cause unexpected server crashes, lag, or downtime. Use it only on servers you have permission to test.
Performance Degradation: Running a load test can severely impact server performance, especially if testing with many threads or large data sizes.
Network Congestion: Excessive load testing can also impact the broader network infrastructure. Be sure to conduct tests in a controlled environment.
Always obtain explicit permission before running tests on third-party servers.
